## ABOUT:
This is my rendition of the classic minesweeper game written in python.
As of now it is only a terminal based game; however, I intend to have a GUI
component once the terminal based version is complete.

## NOTICE:
Currently the game is incomplete.

## USAGE:
usage: minesweeper.py [-h] [-E | -M | -H] [-m MINES] [-r ROWS] [-c COLUMNS]
                      [-d DIMENSIONS]

## RUN:
```
./minesweeper.py
```

## FORMAT:
* Unknown       ' '
* Mines:        'm'
* Explosion:    'X'
* Flag:         'F'
* Mark:         '?'
* Warnings:     '1','2','3',...
* Empty         '0'
